Title/User Requirement: 
     	The first User Requirement we will look at is 
     	"The System shall allow the 
     	Inventory Manager or Operations 
     	Manager to create an inventory item."
     
Owner:     
     	I am the owner responsible for fully specifying this requirement.

Rationale:
     	This requirement is necessary for the inventory management feature because
     	the Inventory manager and Operations Manager will need to be able to populate the 
     	inventory with all inventory items. 

Priority: 
	The Priority is HIGH because All other functions of the 
	inventory management system requires the system to allow 
	the user to create an inventory item. This requirement has no
	other dependency.
